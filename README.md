# ðŸ¦€ Multi-withdrawal controller

## Overview
The multi-withdrawal controller is designed to give the portfolio manager finer control over withdrawals processed within the portfolio term.
It allows the manager to set withdrawal exceptions (negotiated off-chain) for investors and process withdrawals based on these exceptions.

This controller offers two modes of processing redemptions/withdrawals.
The modes are mutually exclusive, and which one can be used at a given time is dependent on whether withdrawals are allowed in the current stage of portfolio lifecycle (capital formation/live/closed).

- If withdrawals are allowed in the current stage, investors may withdraw their funds by themselves on regular terms (no fee, share price calculated based on the amount of shares and portfolio liquidity).
- If withdrawals are not allowed, only the manager can perform withdrawals for them using the `multiRedeem` function.

By default, every tranche disallows withdrawals while the portfolio is active or accumulating capital, and allows them after the portfolio term has ended.

## Withdrawal exception
```solidity
enum WithdrawType {
  Interest,
  Principal
}

struct WithdrawalException {
    address lender;
    WithdrawType withdrawType;
    uint256 shareAmount;
    uint256 sharePrice;
    uint256 fee;
}
```
The withdrawal exception model contains the lender address, withdrawal type, the amount of shares they will redeem, a share price relative to asset (for the purpose of this withdrawal) and a withdrawal fee percentage.
The share price and fee are expressed in basis points (10000 BPs = 100%).

## Methods

### Used by the Portfolio Manager
```solidity
function setWithdrawAllowed(bool newWithdrawAllowed, Status portfolioStatus) public
```
Used to allow withdrawals by investors for a particular stage of portfolio lifecycle (capital formation/live/closed).
Portfolio stage/status is represented by the `Status` enum from Structured Portfolio:
```solidity
enum Status {
    CapitalFormation,
    Live,
    Closed
}
```

```solidity
function multiRedeem(address vault, WithdrawalException[] memory exceptions) external
```
Used to action withdrawals based on exceptions for one or more investors.
In order for it to work, the investors must first allow the controller contract to use their portfolio shares token.

```solidity
function setFloor(uint256 newFloor) public
```
Sets the tranche floor (minimum liquidity).
Any withdrawals that would result in portfolio liquid value dropping below this amount before the portfolio term ends will be reverted.
This is respected both by regular and by exception withdrawals.

```solidity
function configure(uint256 newFloor, WithdrawAllowed memory newWithdrawAllowed) external
```
Configures the portfolio floor and allows/disallows withdrawals for one particular stage of portfolio lifecycle.
It accepts the `WithdrawAllowed` structure below.
```solidity
struct WithdrawAllowed {
    Status status;
    bool value;
}
```

### View functions

```solidity
function maxRedeem(address owner) external view returns (uint256)
```
Returns the maximum amount of asset tokens that the `owner` can withdraw, factoring in the available liquidity and portfolio floor.

```solidity
function maxWithdraw(address owner) public view returns (uint256)
```
Returns the maximum amount of shares tokens that the `owner` can redeem, factoring in the available liquidity and portfolio floor.

## Actors

Two actors are meant to interact with the `MultiWithdrawalController` directly: Portfolio Manager and the `TrancheVault` contract.
Interactions by any other parties are done through transactions made by `TrancheVault`.
### Tranche Vault
The controller is a logic component used by `TrancheVault` to determine withdrawal amounts, as well as who is/is not allowed to withdraw at a given time.
`TrancheVault` represents one of 1..* tranches in a `StructuredPortfolio`.
- the `initialize` function gets called by the `TrancheVault` once, at portfolio creation, and passes initial parameters to the controller
- `maxRedeem`, `maxWithdraw`, `previewRedeem`, `previewWithdraw` are view functions that are intended to be called by the `TrancheVault`.
Their results are only guaranteed to be correct when called by `TrancheVault`, and can be used by `TrancheVault` to preview values before withdraw/redeem functions are called.
- `onRedeem` and `onWithdraw` are called by `TrancheVault` during redeem/withdraw transactions.
### Portfolio Manager
The address managing the portfolio which contains the `TrancheVault` and its controller.
The manager can process withdrawals for multiple investors, as well as configure the contract.
- the `multiRedeem` function makes withdrawals for one or more investors, with the redemption terms
(such as price per share and manager fee) set explicitly by the manager.
This is agreed upon by the manager and investors off-chain and assumes the manager is trustworthy.
- `setFloor`, `setWithdrawAllowed`, `configure` are used by the manager to configure the controller.
See detailed descriptions in function descriptions above.
